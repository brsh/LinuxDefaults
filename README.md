OSDefaults
==========

Configs for some linux and win distros - mostly text-based (bash, cmd, the like).

The Bash configs work in Arch, Ubuntu (& flavors), and CygWin, as well as Red Hat (& flavors).
The RHs require a slight adjustment; I don't use them much, so I don't mind giving them extra steps).
